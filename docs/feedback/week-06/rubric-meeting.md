# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Denisa
Minute taker: Yair

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Agenda is on Gitlab, and contains all necessary elements. Detailed enough for the team to prepare. Consider adding questions to TA in the agenda, so that you don't forget them.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Notes are following the structure of the agenda. Within every agenda, item notes are structured and clear. Focus on the agreements. I think it would be useful to summarize the action points after the meeting in a table with the assignees.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The main focus of the meeting was introduced, and announcements about the upcoming deadlines were also nice. I noticed that you are summarizing the discussions more, very good.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team was completely in charge at the meeting. Everyone participated. The hybrid setup worked fine. Again you had some nice constructive discussions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team has made a huge progress compared to last meeting. I think you are still on track to for sure finish all basic features. Keep in mind that we run some scripts on your repository every Monday on the main branch, so main should be up to date then.
