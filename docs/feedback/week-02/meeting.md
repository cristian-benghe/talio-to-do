# Week 2
## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Yair
- **Notetaker**: David

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Would be nice if you put the names of the chair and minute-taker in the agenda.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: Used shared document so everyone (but the TA :cry:) had access to it on time. Used the template, so all necessary elements were present. Nice that larger topics had subtopics and descriptions.

Notes:
Since you already have access to your team repo you should upload the agenda an appropriate amount of time before the meeting (see the teamwork module and agree on what is the appropriate time for your team). Also, TA meetings should have a separate folder in docs.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair followed the agenda and made sure that all topics are covered. I really liked the fact that the chair stopped discussions when the topic was too far from the agenda and said that it will be discussed at another meeting. However, I noticed that some discussions were slightly dominated by the chair (especially in the second half of the meeting). Next time, try to act more like a moderator of the discussion.

#### Time management

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: There was enough time planned and spent on every topic from the agenda. Also, I really liked the fact that the chair kept track of time and made sure to move on to the next topic when necessary. Also, I think you didn't talk at all about CoC at all, but you could have asked me for some feedback.

#### Minute taker performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: There is a good amount of notes. The notes are focused on the agreements made at the meeting. Some action points are summarized in a table. Nice that the questions to the project owner were collected in a separate section. A tip for next time would be to also organize your notes the same way as the agenda. For example in the 'Notes from the meeting' it's not easy to see which points refer to which points from the agenda.

#### Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Apart from what was mentioned before in the chair performance section, everyone was still actively participating in the meeting. The team has made some agreements, and overall the discussions were productive. Everyone was respectful.
