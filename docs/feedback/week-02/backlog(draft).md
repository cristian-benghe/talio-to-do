### Backlog

Note: As this is just a draft I decided to be a bit more strict and nitpick in the grading. I hope this will help you to understand what you still have to work on to get a high grade for the final backlog. When I give you any examples in the feedback, note that it is usually not exhaustive, and you might have to apply this feedback to other user stories too.


### Submission

Mark: Fail

Feedback: the file is not in the correct location and doesn't have the right name. For the final submission please remember that it should be `/docs/backlog.pdf`.

Note: use numbers instead of bullet points, so that I can refer to specific points in the feedback.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback:
- [x] Stakeholders - I think you can go one step further here. Think about what user groups you will have and how will their needs/requirements differ.
- [x] Terminology - good, maybe you could also add more about the constraints here, for example, can there be a Column with an empty collection of Cards?
- [x] List of user stories
- [ ] Mockups - you could have at least deleted the Mocks section and the red text from last year's official backlog :neutral_face:


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: No use of epics at all. Please refer to the lecture slides to find the epics in this project. Make sure they are prioritized, and detailed enough, and make use of mockups.


### User Stories

Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient

Feedback:
- the user stories do not follow the required format (I as *role* want to *requirement* so I can *reason*) missing reason in a lot of user stories - that's why the mark is insufficient/sufficient.
- I don't understand some of the requirements, example: first and third in must, user
- some of the user stories cover too many features (I get it that you might want to combine related features such as edit and delete for some elements, but sometimes you combine too many things into one)
-  I recommend you read the entire document again and make sure your requirements are complete. example: assigning people to tasks, ok, but does the user see what tasks they are assigned to?
-  I think still you have some work to do regarding the phrasing, reorganizing the user stories (add epics!!), and checking the completeness.
- Other than that it doesn't seem that there is too much overlap between user stories, I also haven't noticed any bigger gaps.

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback:
Not all user stories are specific enough for me to clearly understand what the acceptance criteria would be. For example the last one, or the second one on the second page. How is that a feature? Or interaction by using the keyboard, from your backlog I can't see what does it mean that this user story is complete? When you read the entire document again look for this kind of ambiguity and clarify that. You can add sub-points for that.
