# Get to know each other

## Formative Assessment

#### 1) Self-organization

**Good**

The team was completely in charge. Some people did not participate in the discussion on the code of conduct. Other than that, the discussion was productive and respectful, agreements were made.

#### 2) Suggested Topics

**Excellent**

I really like the fact that the team tried to keep track of time and not spend too long on every point from the code of conduct. In the end, there was still not much time to cover the last two points and they were done really fast (still better than not doing them at all!).

### Note
There was no Teamwork lecture yet, so this is understandable that you don't know everything yet. That's why I decided to be a bit more lenient this time. Please, have a look at Teamwork Module 2 for next time.
