# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Teodora Mihăilă
Minute taker: Halid

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was delivered on time. All necessary elements are present. The points are clear enough for the team members to be able to prepare for the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker (Denisa)

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Follow the structure of the agenda. CFocus on what decisions were made in the discussions and important information from the TA. The summary of action points didn't really contain the specific tasks and assignees. I think you talked more about planning at your internal meeting and focus on brainstorming at our meetings (also good).


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: I like that the chair reminded everyone about the upcoming deadlines, so I didn't have to :smile:. Made use of the approval of the agenda. Sometimes, the lead was taken from the chair. However, the chair knew when to step in and cut the discussions that were digressing too far from the agenda point. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: As always you have really nice discussions, and everyone was active. However, I noticed that this time your discussions were becoming a bit too unorganized. In the future make sure everyone respects the chair and lets them moderate the discussions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: I know you have done some work in the past week. However, you had nothing to show me for the demo which is quite concerning. Because of that, I can't really judge if you are on track or not. I hope next time you will be able to show me your application working.
