# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Cristian
Minute taker: Denisa

Mark: Pass

Feedback: New chair and minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Delivered on time. Agenda followed the template, therefore all necessary elements were present. Individual points were clear enough so that the team could prepare for the meeting. Also, mention some subtopics.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: There is a good amount of notes. The notes are focused on the agreements made at the meeting. Some action points are summarized in a table. Nice that the questions to the project owner were collected in a separate section. A tip for next time would be to also organize your notes the same way as the agenda. For example in the 'Notes from the meeting' it's not easy to see which points refer to which points from the agenda.

Note: copy from last week


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: I really liked how the chair summarized the focus of the meeting at the beginning. Also, nice to see that you are actually using the approval of the agenda to make any necessary adjustments and not just mention it to tick off the agenda point. The chair introduced how the backlog discussion will be structured and acted more like a moderator. Agenda was followed and the chair kept track of time to spend enough but not too long on each agenda item.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team was completely in charge at the meeting. Everyone was active. I also noticed more balance between the team member's activities. Great discussions, all of you brought up some interesting points, at the same time you listen to each other and take into account everyone's opinion. Honestly, your discussions are always interesting to listen to, I think you have great ideas and I'm curious about your product.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: No coding done yet, so no demo. The team, however, has already started talking about coding (a detailed plan discussed after TA meeting), so I think you are still on track.
