# Frontend/Backend tasks division
   ### Discuss about the product pitch video
      * For the draft we don't have to upload the full video
      * Slideshow presentation in powerpoint with the main ideas of the project than dive in the application demo
      * We should talk about the advanced featurres in the:"How would you extend the application, technically or content-wise (ca. 1min)" bulletpoint
      * Plan meeting for the Product Pitch
      * We can cut the video
      * Show the features the video in order of the task prioritization

   ### Discuss about the Task and Planning rubric
     * Improve the coordination of the team using gitlab tools by
       * Once you make a commit push the commit with the branch to the repository, so other people can branch from your commit before you are done with yours and start to add comments to the code changes using the GitLab tools- should be added code of conduct
       * Effort estination- Discuss briefly how long shoud a task take when making an issue.
       * More complex label system, not only by epic but also client/erver side - helpful for backend/frontend 

     * Merge main to dev and then dev to main to be sure we don't have conflicts
     * Merge with main 2 times a week Wednesday/Sunday- to be added to the code of conduct
     

   ### Brainstorm:
     * TODO Create issues for the advanced features
     * It's ok to work on frontend and backend in the same time, even more efficient
     * We could start an advanced feature before completing the other advanced features before it. A little bit of overlapping is allowed
     * Finish the rearragment of cards in a column(Pretty specific in the backlog that it should be a drag and drop, but maybeeeeee other methods can be used) and drag and drop between columns- the last things from the basic features.
     * Special meeting for solving bugs, check if all user storys are completed before starting the advaced features
     * We should be making used of the gitlab tools mentioned before

   * Halid: drag and drop for cards in a column and for columns
   * David - Admin configuration for multi board+ Shortcuts
   * Cristian- Local file for workspace + Autosync for the rest of the features + drag and drop for columns + boardOverview button for admin/user for deletion/hiding a board in the board list/workspace
